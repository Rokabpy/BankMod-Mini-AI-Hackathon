# AI Mini Hackathon : Openhouse KMUTT
This competition is part of the CPE AI Mini Hackathon Openhouse at KMUTT Openhouse. It's divided into two stages, which are the qualifying stage and the final stage. After I see this, I want to challenge myself because this competition in the qualifying stage is not allowed to use any deep learning model, automated machine learning, or automated parameter tuning libraries.

## Qualifying Stage
I want to try something about support vector machines from scratch. The first time, I tried the radial basis function (RBF), and I found this took quite a lot of time to train. After that, I tried using an approximate RBF.

## Final Stage
I received two questions about medical image prediction and medical data classification that are about binary classification, but before I go into solving the problem, I have a question about the medical image problem that can be fixed by avoiding images. and it's work, so I solved these 2 problems by neural network.
